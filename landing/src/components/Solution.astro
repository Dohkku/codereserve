  <h2 data-i18n="solution_title">The Mechanism</h2>
  <p class="freetext" data-i18n="solution_text">We introduce a Reputation Shield for Pull Requests.

Phase 1 - The Gatekeeper: When a PR is opened, we calculate a Risk Score based on GitHub account age, historical merges in protected repos, and whitelist status.

Phase 2 - The Outcome:
• Low Risk: PR accepted immediately. Label: CR-Trusted.
• High Risk (new/flagged accounts): PR auto-closed with instructions.

Phase 3 - The Security Deposit (Bail):
Unverified users can deposit $5 to re-open their PR.
• PR Merged or Closed: Deposit refunded automatically.
• Maintainer flags as Spam: Deposit slashed to repo treasury.

Result: Trusted devs work freely. New contributors prove intent with a refundable deposit. Spam becomes financially painful.

FOR MAINTAINERS
Stop reviewing noise.
Install the GitHub App. Set your reputation threshold. Done.
Trusted contributors pass through. Unknowns provide a deposit. You keep full control over what gets merged.

FOR CONTRIBUTORS
Your reputation follows you.
Build merit across protected repos. Once trusted, you never pay.
New to the ecosystem? A $5 refundable deposit proves you're serious.
If your code is good, it costs you nothing.

FOR COMPANIES
Your dependencies are maintained by burned-out volunteers.
Fund the Treasury: Send funds directly to a project's smart contract.
These funds become bounties for verified contributors.
Transparent. On-chain. Accountable.</p>
