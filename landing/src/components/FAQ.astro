  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <article>
    <h3>Don't similar tools already exist? (Tea.xyz, Gitcoin...)</h3>
    <p>Yes. Their incentives are broken.

Tea.xyz: Pays based on dependency graphs. This incentivizes low-quality submissions to farm tokens. They add noise; we filter it.

Gitcoin: Relies on donations and goodwill. We're a merit-based system: proven contributors work freely, unknowns prove intent with a refundable deposit.

We're Reputation First. The deposit is a last resort, not a gate.</p>

    <h3>Why Blockchain?</h3>
    <p>Programmable escrow, transparent treasuries, and permissionless reputation. Traditional payment rails don't support automatic refunds based on PR outcomes. We use crypto as infrastructure. No tokens. No speculation.</p>

    <h3>Is this pay-to-play?</h3>
    <p>No. It's Reputation First.

Trusted contributors (good account history, previous merges) work for free. Only unverified accounts need to provide a Security Deposit, and it's fully refunded when the PR is reviewed.

If you're legitimate, it costs nothing.</p>

    <h3>Who runs this?</h3>
    <p>One dev building the MVP. Goal: decentralized protocol governed by the maintainers and contributors doing the work.</p>
