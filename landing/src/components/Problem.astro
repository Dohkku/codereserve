  <h2 data-i18n="problem_title">The Reality</h2>
  <p class="freetext" data-i18n="problem_text">Maintainers are burnt out.

Filtering noise is unpaid labor.

If this continues, maintainers will quit and critical infrastructure will rot. You shouldn't have to choose between an open repo and your sanity.</p>
